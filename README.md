## A Typical Workflow

1.  **Research & Collect (Library)**: Start a new project and use the Library view to search for articles. As you find relevant content, use the AI Assistant to vet them and click "Add to Compilation" to gather your sources.
2.  **Organize & Refine (Compiler)**: Switch to the Compiler view. Here, you'll see all your collected articles. Drag and drop them into a logical order. Dive into the export settings to style your final document.
3.  **Publish & Share (Export)**: Once you're satisfied, click "Generate PDF" or "Export Markdown". Your professionally formatted document, complete with a table of contents and bibliography, is ready.
4.  **Build Your Knowledge Base (Archive)**: Over time, the Archive view becomes your personal, offline encyclopedia filled with every article you've ever explored.

## Built with Google AI Studio

This application was developed using **[Google AI Studio](https://ai.studio/apps/drive/1yyz5W0rD85UmlKj6X2vkwrX-SGMrQQmZ)**. AI Studio is a web-based IDE that allows developers to rapidly prototype and build generative AI applications. It provides a streamlined workflow for iterating on prompts, tuning models, and integrating them with application code.

The development of Wiki Compiler was significantly accelerated by AI Studio's capabilities, enabling the seamless integration of the Google Gemini model for its core AI features. You can explore a snapshot of the development process for this app directly in AI Studio via the link above.

## Technical Stack

*   **Framework**: React with TypeScript
*   **Styling**: Tailwind CSS (with JIT via CDN)
*   **State Management**: React Hooks (State, Context, Effects)
*   **Local Storage**: IndexedDB (via `idb` library for robust offline storage)
*   **AI Integration**: Google Gemini API (`@google/genai`)
*   **PDF Generation**: `html2pdf.js`

### AI Feature Configuration

To enable the AI Research Assistant, a valid Google Gemini API key is required.

**IMPORTANT**: The API key **must** be provided as an environment variable named `API_KEY` in the execution environment. The application is designed to securely access this variable. For security reasons, there is no UI to enter the key directly. Without this key, AI-related features will be gracefully disabled.
